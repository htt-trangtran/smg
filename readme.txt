Our code consists of two folders: Neural_Network and Logistic_Regression, where
you will find the full code for the respective models. If you want to implement 
a short version of every algorithm, you may choose to run file run_demo.py in the
Logistic_Regression folder.

Our run_demo.py file implements 4 algorithms using w8a dataset for ONLY 3 EPOCHS.
Then the results are plotted automatically. You can modify the code if more epochs 
is needed. 

On the other hand, you can start with the run.py files in each folder, which contain
the hyper-parameter tuning setting for each of our experiments. Four algorithms 
used (denoted by SMG, SGD, SGDM, and ADAM) and four learning rate schemes can be 
found in the respective Python files: algorithms.py and schedule_LR.py.
